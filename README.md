# 💘 val-by-force

A Valentine website that asks a simple question  
and refuses to accept **No** as an answer.

## 🧠 What is this?

`val-by-force` is a playful Valentine project where the user is asked to be your Valentine…  
and the “No” button immediately regrets existing.

The button doesn't work.  
The answer changes.  
Destiny wins.
